### Hi
## I'm DiamondsBattle, sometimes called Duffer ! I am a French student who mostly does pentesting and video games, but I also work on Minecraft modding too
### I mostly code in Python, so you'll almost only find Python repos (at least the public ones :p) on my profile
### I mostly program the following stuff :
- 3D Video Games (using the awesome Ursina Engine !)
- General pentesting stuff, usually related to network hacking
- Minecraft mods or stuff, currently wokring on the Balistic Minecraft Server
- Game cheats ; these are almost only just memory editing, nothing incredible
- Machine Learning... I actually am just interested and I am learning how to use/make it
